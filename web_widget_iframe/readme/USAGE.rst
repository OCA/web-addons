For a char field, especially URLs, just set the widget as 'iframe'.
An iframe will be displayed.
You also must be aware of the sandbox attribute.
Please check this `link <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-sandbox>`_.
The sandbox and style attributes can be directly set on the field tag.
